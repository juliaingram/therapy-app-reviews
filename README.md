# Scraping Teletherapy App Reviews from the Apple App Store

## Goal
This project aims to investigate issues that teletherapy apps may present users by examining app store reviews. /why this is important, teletherapy growing/. In light of this, I scraped reviews from the Apple App Store and built a classifier to predict which 1- and 2- star reviews included reports of unfair charges, unresponsive therapists, or unsatisfactory care. 

## Findings
